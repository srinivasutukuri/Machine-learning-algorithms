# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my machine learning algorithms repository! In this repository, you'll find a collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch, along with some examples of how to use them. Additionally, I've included a comparison with scikit-learn models to demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms.

Introduction

Machine learning is a fascinating field, and this repository is dedicated to implementing some fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch. These implementations are intended for educational purposes and to gain a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood.

Algorithms

Here's a list of the machine learning algorithms currently available in this repository:

-Simple Linear Regression Implemented using ordinary least square. 
-Simple Linear Regression Implemented using gradient descent. 

Usage

To use these algorithms in your projects, you can simply clone this repository and import the corresponding Python files into your code. Each algorithm is organized into its own file for easy integration.
